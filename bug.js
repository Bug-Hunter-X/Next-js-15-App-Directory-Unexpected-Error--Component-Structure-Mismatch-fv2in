```javascript
// pages/index.js
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>Hello</div>
  );
}
```

This simple Next.js 15 app produces an unexpected error when using the `app` directory.  The error message will vary but commonly indicates issues with `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, or routing within the app directory.  The core issue is often a mismatch between how the component is structured and how Next.js expects it to be handled in the app directory.

The error might manifest as a 500 error or an internal server error.  The debugging process usually involves checking for incorrect function usage and the `page` file naming conventions within the app directory.
