# Next.js 15 App Directory Unexpected Error

This repository demonstrates a common unexpected error in Next.js 15's app directory. The error stems from a mismatch between the component's structure and Next.js's expectations for the app directory.  This typically manifests as a 500 error or an internal server error, often linked to data fetching functions or routing inconsistencies.

## Reproducing the Issue

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the error in the browser console.

## Solution

The solution often involves double-checking the component structure.  Common mistakes include the incorrect use of `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` within the app directory, or improper file naming conventions that can disrupt routing.  Correcting these issues will usually resolve the unexpected error.
